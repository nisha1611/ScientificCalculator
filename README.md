Problem Statement : Creating a scientific calculator to solve arithmetic, trigonometric and logarithmic expressions; to store and process variables and functions.

Functionalities:
1. Users can enter expressions and get the evaluated result.
2. Users can assign, save and update the value of a variable.
3. Users can define and call functions.
4. Users can import a file containing expressions and declarations, and process its contents

Major Classes and Interfaces :-
1. Evaluable: This interface is implemented by all operators, variables, functions and numeric constants.
It contains an evaluate method which returns a double value after evaluation.
2. Evaluator: Tokenizes the expression string and creates an expression tree to evaluate. 
3. HashTable: Implements a hash table which maps variables to their corresponding values and functions to their corresponding expressions.

Some important functions in the code:
1. makeTree() : Scans a tokenized linked list, categorizes the tokens into variable, function, operator or numeric value to construct an expression tree and returns an evaluable object as the root of the tree.
2. evaluate() : This function is implemented by all evaluable classes like variable, function, numeric, and all operators. It evaluates the node and returns double value.
3. generateHash() : It returns a unique hash key for a variable using quadratic probing. 
4. tokenize() : Accepts expression string entered by users and creates tokens based on operators, numeric values, variables, etc. Returns a linked list of tokens.

Other Features of the project:-
1. Balanced parentheses are added to user input by addParanthesis() function to facilitate easy evaluation.
2. Syntax errors are handled using the exception handling feature of Java.
3. Other handled exceptions: Function redefinition, Function/Variable/File not found, Use of unknown symbols.
4. User Interface: Prompts user to enter input using specific keywords like Func, import, exit. 

***Run UserInterface.java to test the working.
